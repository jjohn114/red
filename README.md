# Memebot
Telegram bot that downloads memes (or really any kind of images) from Reddit and sends them to users via Telegram at request.
There is a filter for how many upvotes a post needs to be considered by the bot, that filter can be altered in the config.ini file.



### Use /start to start a conversation with the bot.

### When asking for one of the suggested subs, a menu will pop up asking for how many images from  that subreddit should be sent.
